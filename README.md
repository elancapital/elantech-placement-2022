## Introduction

Two useful tools for data visualisation are Python and Dash. We think the best way to judge your abilities is to give you the chance to show what you can do.

This repo has a very basic example of a dashboard showing some elements of US economic activity from the start of 2019 to now.

The example data is sourced from the US Federal Reserve database (FRED - https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) and Yahoo Finance (https://uk.finance.yahoo.com) but feel free to add other data sources.

We would like you to take this example and build on it. Show us what you can do, show us some nice looking code, show us some cool visualisations.

Feel free to change anything in the project!

## How To Apply

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b MyAwesomeVersion`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some awesome changes'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin MyAwesomeVersion`)
5. Email us with a link to your repo and your CV
